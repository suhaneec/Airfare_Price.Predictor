# ✈️ Airfare Price Predictor  

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-App-red)](https://airfare-price-predictor.streamlit.app/)

## 📌 Overview  
Airfare Price Predictor is a **machine learning-powered web application** that predicts flight ticket prices based on various factors like airline, departure time, arrival time, duration, total stops, and more. The application is built using **Streamlit** for the front-end and **Scikit-learn** for the backend model.
